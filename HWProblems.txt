1. 
    a) The first move is to the east instead of the north given the adgent doesn't know which cells are blocked because that is the fastest 
    naive way to get to the goal state. The heuristics from A to T will be so small that the agent will continuously attempt to go straight
    towards the goal of T.
    b) The agent is guaranteed, in finite gridworlds, to either reach the target or discover it is impossible in finite time due to
    how the pathfinding determines which cells to go to. All possibilities will be considered as the agent uncovers more of the maze
    and will plan out a path that minimizes the number of cells that need to be expanded. In the worst case scenario, all cells in the maze
    will have been searched, limiting the time to O(n^2) where n is the width/height of a square maze with identical dimensions. The 
    number of moves is bounded from above by the number of unblocked cells squared because of the way the agent traverses the grid. In
    such a worst case scenario, the agent will continuously plan out a path but be blocked at each step. Thus, it will continue down a 
    poor path until it is blocked in. At that moment, it will need to re-trace and go back the path traversed to continue down a similar path.
    Therefore, a viscious cycle is continuously enacted where the agent must traverse each cell multiple times, but no more than n^2
    because then the maze would have been impossible to solve and the agent would stop
